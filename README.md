Yubiquitous-OATH
================

a Yubikey-based secure OATH secret storage service, thus allowing effectively (as a workaround) the use of a yubikey to login in websites that only support OATH TOTPs (HMAC-SHA1 based TOTPs, e.i. "the google defacto standard"), effectively switching the something you have "the phone" for the something you have "the yubikey".
